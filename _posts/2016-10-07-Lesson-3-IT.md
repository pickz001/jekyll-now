    <td>I managed to get to chapter 4 'We have apples'. I am now making enough progress and are being able to keep up with my class. The strategy that worked best for me was reading a whole chapter and copying it into my own computer. I also looked at all the pictures and read all the extra hints.I also starting making amendments to my github page,the first thing I did was change the backround colour to green which is my favourite colour.At first I didn't know what to do so I went to the W3 Schools website and they had a solution and then I experimented on my blog and it worked. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Although I was at chapter 4(pg 24), one of my peers managed to get to chapter 6(pg41). This gave me inspiration and now I am determined to be the top of my class.

The thing that limited my learning was the fact I let another pair touch our keyboard. I was stuck on a certain stage and the pair next to us offered to help,but what we didn't know is that they hadn't actually completed it and ended up deleting our work.</td>
