    <td>I read aloud whilst my partner typed, we timed 5 minute slots using our iPads. Every 5 mins we would switch positions.I also went to the W3 Schoools website to find out how to create rounded corners, I then copied the code over to my blog and it worked. I then looked up how to make the backround white so I could still read the text as well.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be able to start sooner as I know where I saved my work from the previous lesson. I also came up with the idea that each time we finished a certain sector we would save it to ensure we knew what it was called and when we did it</td>
