    <td>Overall, 8% is amazing in the world of python so I am very proud of myself. In my class, I am currently one of the people ahead of the other pupils. I am also starting to get into the harder part of coding so I don't think it will be possible to maintain a good pace as the work is harder. But I will try.</td>
