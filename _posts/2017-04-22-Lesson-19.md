    <td>This week there was a Blog Assessment, and I think that it went well, as I only had two points of improvement which I noted down in my planner. In the lesson, I made 5% progress in the world of python which is very good. After finding out my flaws, I started to fix them, I started adding a table to lesson 1 and it worked, after this lesson or maybe next week I will add it to all of my blogs.</td>
