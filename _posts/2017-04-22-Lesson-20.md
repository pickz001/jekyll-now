    <td>Today we started a brand new topic, Python 3. I was pleased with my progress and I managed to complete the simple tasks that were set, such as telling a joke or doing simple maths questions. However, this is the penultimate week of IT as I have been doing it for 2 terms, I am pleased with my progress during IT and I will hopefully manage to complete Python on Codecademy during the holiday.</td>
