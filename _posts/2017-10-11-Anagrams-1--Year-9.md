    <td>Today was our first lesson of Year 9 and we were starting with the subject 'Anagrams'. I liked it as it was the first chance I had to code in a long time. We started simply with the formula ‘Vlookup’. We then used this formula to create a simple anagram coder that would code a message for us. The task was successful and very fun.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I managed to get very far with this task and have definitely improved since the beginning of the lesson. Next time I need to remember that some buttons perform certain tasks as a shortcut and I need to learn some to improve my typing speed. This would mean that I get further in my work.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that I speed up with my coding so I manage to complete all the tasks set and benefit from the lesson. If I speed up my work I will definitely improve as I can learn more in each lesson.</td>
