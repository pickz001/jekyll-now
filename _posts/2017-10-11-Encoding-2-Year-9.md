    <td>Following the last lesson, this lesson we improved our anagram coders by again using the 'Vlookup' formula to create a decoding function. After a couple of attempts I managed to complete this task and my coder was starting to take shape. For the second-half of the lesson, we applied our knowledge of the previous code to add punctuation to our messages that we were sending. </td>
