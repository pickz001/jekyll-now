    <td>Today we started a new function, this function was called 'Concatenate' and it merged all the letters in one cell together and overall made the encoded message neater. As I had already researched this topic I made short work of it and had now completed the entire ‘Anagram’ topic.</td>

    <td>The lesson went really well as I had no difficulty and was able to finish just in time to write my weekly blog. Overall I believe I have made very good progress during the topic ‘Anagrams’ and will hopefully be able to do so in all my IT lessons.</td>

    <td>As I finished early, i have started to write my evaluation and that has gone very well so far. Next week I will listen very carefully so that my blog has all the necessary points to explain the ‘Anagram’ topic and achieve a high mark.</td>
