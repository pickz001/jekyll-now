    <td>This was the final week before half term, and we were tasked with placing a video into our blog posts, unfortunately, I did not manage to complete the task as I worked a bit slow and spent most of the lesson searching for the right video to talk about. This means that I will have to finish it off during the holidays but I don't really mind as it means I can take more care with it.</td>

    <td>I think that this slight blip was good as it has made me a more effective time manager and of course I managed to learn from my mistakes which made it beneficial. Next time, I will use these new skills to make sure that this never happens again.</td>
