    <td>Today was the final task for the Anagram coder(for now), and we had the whole lesson to finish off our 'Encoding and Decoding' topic. As I had already finished this task last week, I took advantage and started making it look nicer, so I added numerous vibrant colours to the cells and changed the spacing of the cells in preparation for next week. I knew that  next week we were adding our final function which would be the ‘Concatenate’ function, as a result I looked it up on Google to grasp a better understanding of it.</td>
