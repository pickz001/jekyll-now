    <td>Our homework from the previous week was to add 3 extra questions to our AI, I managed to complete this task with ease as it was just copying the 'resp' and ‘print’ functions all over again. However, in the lesson I made very little progress as none of the computers I tried worked until we had 15 minutes left. So for homework I am going to complete worksheet 3 and 4.</td>
