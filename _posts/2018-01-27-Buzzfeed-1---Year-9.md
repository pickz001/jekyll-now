    <td>This lesson we were asked to visit the Buzzfeed quiz webpage and do one of the online quizzes, I chose one which would decide my future dog breed if I ever got a dog. Then we were tasked with creating a google doc which would entail my own buzzfeed quiz questions and answers.</td>

    <td>I would say that this lesson if I chose my buzzfeed topic a bit faster, as well as thinking of the questions quicker, then I would of had less homework which would have been a big benefit to my overall work.</td>
