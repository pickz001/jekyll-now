    <td>This was our first week back on the new rota and I was excited to find out that I got IT. I had done repl.it before, so I was familiar with the controls, we were set a simple task of creating an AI person that would ask us a couple of simple questions. I managed to get mine working very early on as a result of my hard working.</td>
